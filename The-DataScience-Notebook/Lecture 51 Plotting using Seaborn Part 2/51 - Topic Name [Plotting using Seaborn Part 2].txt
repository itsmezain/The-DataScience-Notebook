1- Categorical Plot (theory):
	
	a) Categorical Scatter Plot (theory, when to use them):
	    i) Strip plot (theory), jitter, hue parameter
	    ii) Swarm plot (theory)
	
	b) Categorical Disribution Plots (theory)
	    i) Box plot (theory), how to plot it, hue, facet plot
	    ii) Violint plot (theory), how to pot it, hue, split

	c) Categorical Estimare plots (theory):
	    i) Bar plot (theroy), how to plot it, error bar, hue, 	       estimator (mean,mdain, std dev, min, max, etc.)

	    ii) Point Plot (theory), how to plot, error bar, hue, 		        estimator (mean,mdain, std dev, min, max, etc.)

	    iii) Count plot (theory) and others things
	    iv) Faceting plot

2- Regression Plot (theory):
	i) how to plot, axes and figure level function, hue parameters, others ways to improve the plot.

	ii) residplot (theory), how to plot it and other things

3- Multi plots (theory):
	a) facet grid (theory), differnece between row,col facet plot, when to use which one
	
	b) pairplot (theory), code, hue
	c) pairGrid (thoery), differnce than pairplot, when to use it, using map_diag, map_offdiag, map_upper, map_lower and other parameter in the PairGrid

	d) Joint Grid:
	   i) Jointplot (theory), how to plot, when to use it, code, hue and kind and other parameter
	   ii) JointGrid (thoery), difference, when to use it, code, hue and other parameters
