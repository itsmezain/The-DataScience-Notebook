    "\n",
    "### 1.1 What is an Exception?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **exception** is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. The exception indicates that there is an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, dividing by zero raises a `ZeroDivisionError` exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Difference Between Syntax Errors and Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax Errors**: Occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement, e.g., missing a colon or parenthesis.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if True\n",
    "        print(\"Hello\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n",
    "        if True\n",
    "               ^\n",
    "    SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exceptions**: Occur during execution; even if the code is syntactically correct, it may lead to errors when running.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",

    "\n",
    "Python has a rich set of built-in exceptions to handle various error conditions. Some common exceptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exception**: Base class for all exceptions.\n",
    "- **ArithmeticError**: Base class for arithmetic errors.\n",
    "  - **ZeroDivisionError**: Division or modulo by zero.\n",
    "  - **OverflowError**: Result too large to be represented.\n",
    "- **AttributeError**: Attribute reference or assignment fails.\n",
    "- **IndexError**: Sequence index is out of range.\n",
    "- **KeyError**: Mapping (dictionary) key not found.\n",
    "- **NameError**: Name not found.\n",
    "- **TypeError**: Operation or function applied to an object of inappropriate type.\n",
    "- **ValueError**: Function receives argument of correct type but inappropriate value.\n",
    "- **IOError**/**OSError**: Input/output operation fails.\n",
    "- **ImportError**/**ModuleNotFoundError**: Import fails.\n",

    "## 3. The `try` and `except` Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try` and `except` blocks are used to handle exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except ExceptionType:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cannot divide by zero.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Catching Specific Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "It's considered good practice to catch specific exceptions rather than a general exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    data = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / data\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number.\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Handling Multiple Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can handle multiple exceptions in a single `except` clause by specifying a tuple of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise exceptions\n",
    "except (ValueError, TypeError):\n",
    "    # Handle ValueError and TypeError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Using the `else` Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "An optional `else` clause can be added after all `except` clauses. It runs only if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except ExceptionType:\n",
    "    # Handle exception\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Execute if no exception occurred\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 2\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(f\"Result is {result}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Result is 5.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 The `finally` Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It's useful for resource cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except ExceptionType:\n",
    "    # Handle exception\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code to execute regardless of exceptions\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 4. Raising Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Using the `raise` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You can raise an exception explicitly using the `raise` statement.\n",

    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise ExceptionType(\"Error message\")\n",

    "## 5. Creating Custom Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Defining Custom Exception Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions are defined by creating a class that inherits from `Exception` or one of its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Custom exception class.\"\"\"\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add custom attributes or methods as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with Attributes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance, amount):\n",

    "        self.balance = balance\n",
    "        self.amount = amount\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Exception Inheritance Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining custom exceptions, it's good practice to inherit from an appropriate built-in exception class, to make handling more granular.\n",

    "- **BaseException**\n",
    "  - **Exception**\n",
    "    - **ArithmeticError**\n",
    "    - **LookupError**\n",

    "## 6. Exception Chaining and Context\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 The `__cause__` Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is raised during exception handling, the new exception can be associated with the original exception using `raise ... from`.\n",

    "### 6.2 The `__context__` Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "If an exception is raised during the handling of another exception, and the new exception is not explicitly chained using `from`, the new exception's `__context__` attribute is automatically set.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 8.1 Do Not Suppress Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid using bare `except` clauses; they can catch and suppress all exceptions, including system-exiting exceptions like `KeyboardInterrupt` and `SystemExit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad Practice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    pass  # BAD: Suppresses all exceptions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2 Be Specific with Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Catch specific exceptions to avoid hiding bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good Practice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise ValueError or TypeError\n",
    "except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n",
    "    # Handle specific exceptions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.3 Avoid Bare Except Clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you must catch all exceptions, use `except Exception:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",

    "### 8.4 Resource Management with `finally`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `finally` block or context managers to ensure resources are properly released.\n",

    "    # Process file\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 8.5 Use Built-in Exceptions When Appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before creating a custom exception, check if a built-in exception fits the use case.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **What is Exception Handling?**\n",
    "Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to handle runtime errors gracefully, ensuring the program doesn't crash unexpectedly. Instead of terminating the program, exception handling provides a way to catch errors and execute alternative code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is an Exception?**\n",
    "An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts its normal flow. Common exceptions include:\n",
    "- **`ZeroDivisionError`**: Dividing a number by zero.\n",
    "- **`TypeError`**: Applying an operation to an incompatible type.\n",
    "- **`ValueError`**: Passing invalid arguments to a function.\n",
    "- **`FileNotFoundError`**: Trying to open a file that doesn’t exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exception Hierarchy in Python**\n",
    "Python exceptions are organized into a hierarchy, with all exceptions derived from the base class **`BaseException`**.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax of Exception Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "except ExceptionType:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if no exception occurs\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code to execute no matter what happens\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Components of Exception Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`try` Block**:\n",
    "   - Contains the code that may raise an exception.\n",
    "   - Python executes this block and immediately jumps to the `except` block if an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`except` Block**:\n",
    "   - Handles the exception.\n",
    "   - Can specify a specific exception type or leave it blank to handle all exceptions.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       num = 10 / 0\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`else` Block**:\n",
    "   - Executes if no exception occurs in the `try` block.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       num = 10 / 2\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"Division successful:\", num)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`finally` Block**:\n",
    "   - Executes regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",
    "   - Useful for cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "   except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "       print(\"File not found!\")\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       print(\"Cleanup actions\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Multiple Exceptions**\n",
    "You can handle multiple exceptions using separate `except` blocks or a single block with a tuple of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Separate `except` Blocks**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = int(\"abc\")\n",

    "    print(\"An error occurred\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Custom Exceptions**\n",
    "You can define your own exceptions by creating a class derived from `Exception`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Raising Exceptions**\n",
    "Use the `raise` keyword to manually raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def check_positive(num):\n",
    "    if num < 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Number must be positive\")\n",
    "    return num\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    print(check_positive(-5))\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Nested Try-Except**\n",
    "You can nest `try-except` blocks for more granular error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = 10 / 0\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Chaining Exceptions**\n",
    "Exception chaining shows the context of exceptions using the `__cause__` or `__context__` attributes.\n",

    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Inner exception\")\n",
    "    except ValueError as e:\n",

    "    print(\"Cause:\", e.__cause__)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Practices for Exception Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Be Specific**:\n",
    "   - Catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic `except`.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / 0\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Handle division by zero\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoid Bare Except**:\n",
    "   - Catching all exceptions can hide unexpected errors.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       risky_operation()\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"Error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use `finally` for Cleanup**:\n",
    "   - Always release resources like files or database connections.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       file.close()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Don’t Use Exceptions for Control Flow**:\n",
    "   - Avoid using exceptions for logic that can be handled with regular conditions.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Bad practice\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = my_list[10]\n",
    "   except IndexError:\n",
    "       print(\"Index out of range\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Log Exceptions**:\n",
    "   - Use logging instead of printing errors.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / 0\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "       logging.error(\"Error occurred\", exc_info=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Built-in Exception Classes**\n",
    "Some commonly used built-in exceptions:\n",
    "- **`ValueError`**: Raised when a function receives an argument of the right type but inappropriate value.\n",
    "- **`TypeError`**: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an inappropriate type.\n",
    "- **`KeyError`**: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n",
    "- **`IndexError`**: Raised when a sequence index is out of range.\n",
    "- **`FileNotFoundError`**: Raised when a file operation fails.\n",

    "The `else` block in Python's exception handling isn't just for \"beauty\" — it serves a **specific purpose**. While you could often achieve the same functionality by writing all your code inside the `try` block, using the `else` block improves **clarity**, **intent**, and **code organization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose of the `else` Block**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` block is executed only when **no exceptions are raised** in the `try` block. It is used to separate the code that:\n",
    "1. Should run **only if the `try` block succeeds** without any errors.\n",
    "2. Does **not need to be protected** by the `try` block because it can't raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation makes the code cleaner and emphasizes that the `else` block will only execute if everything in the `try` block goes smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Not Write Everything in the `try` Block?**\n",
    "You *could* write all the code inside the `try` block, but it has some drawbacks:\n",
    "1. **Harder Debugging**: When everything is in the `try` block, it's harder to pinpoint what might raise an exception. The `else` block narrows down the scope of error-prone code.\n",
    "2. **Unintended Exception Handling**: If you include non-error-prone code in the `try` block, you might catch exceptions unrelated to the actual risky operations.\n",
    "3. **Readability**: The `else` block explicitly signals that the code in it should only run after a successful `try` block. This improves understanding for anyone reading the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Without `else` Block**\n",
    "Here’s a code example without an `else` block:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))  # Risky operation\n",
    "    result = 100 / num                   # Another risky operation\n",
    "    print(\"The result is:\", result)      # Non-risky operation\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the `print(\"The result is:\", result)` line doesn’t need to be in the `try` block because it doesn’t raise exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example With `else` Block**\n",
    "Using an `else` block separates the risky code from the code that doesn’t need exception handling:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))  # Risky operation\n",
    "    result = 100 / num                   # Another risky operation\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # This code runs only if no exceptions are raised\n",
    "    print(\"The result is:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it clear that the `print` statement is not error-prone and only executes if the previous operations succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When Should You Use `else`?**\n",
    "- Use `else` when you have **post-success actions** that should only run after the `try` block succeeds.\n",
    "- It’s most useful when:\n",
    "  1. You need to ensure **exception-prone code is separate** from non-exception-prone code.\n",
    "  2. You want to make your code **more readable** and easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When Should You Avoid `else`?**\n",
    "If the code in the `else` block is trivial or you're not concerned about separating risky and non-risky operations, you can safely avoid using `else`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaway**\n",
    "The `else` block is not just for aesthetic purposes — it’s about improving **clarity**, **organization**, and ensuring **intentional exception handling**. While optional, it can make your code more structured and easier to maintain in complex scenarios."

    "# Custom Exceptions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions in Python allow developers to define their own exception classes to represent specific error conditions that are meaningful for their application. Instead of relying only on built-in exceptions like `ValueError` or `KeyError`, you can create custom exceptions to improve error handling and make your code more readable, maintainable, and tailored to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Custom Exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specificity**: Custom exceptions allow for more granular error handling specific to your application logic.\n",
    "2. **Readability**: They make your code easier to understand by providing meaningful names for exceptions.\n",
    "3. **Extensibility**: They can be extended to include custom attributes or methods.\n",

    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Custom exception for a specific error condition.\"\"\"\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class FileProcessingError(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Exception raised for errors during file processing.\"\"\"\n",

    "## Using Custom Exceptions in a Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "For larger projects, you can define a hierarchy of exceptions to handle related errors systematically.\n",

    "### Example: Exception Hierarchy\n",

    "## Best Practices for Custom Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inherit from `Exception`**: Always derive custom exceptions from `Exception` or a subclass.\n",
    "2. **Use Meaningful Names**: Name your exceptions clearly to indicate what they represent (e.g., `InvalidUserInputError`).\n",
    "3. **Provide Context**: Include attributes or arguments that help identify the source or reason for the error.\n",
    "4. **Document Your Exceptions**: Add docstrings to explain when and why the exception should be raised.\n",
    "5. **Organize Exceptions**: Group related exceptions in a module or hierarchy for better organization.\n",
