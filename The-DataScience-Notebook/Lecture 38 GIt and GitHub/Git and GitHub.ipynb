    "## 🔹 i) What is Merging?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Merging** in Git is the process of combining changes from one branch into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 In simple words:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Hey Git, take all the changes made on this other branch and apply them to the branch I’m currently on.”\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example**:  \n",
    "You're on `main`, and want to bring in the changes from `feature-x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge feature-x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will apply `feature-x`’s commits into `main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 ii) What Happens During Merging?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you merge a branch into the current branch, Git performs these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ A new commit is created (in most cases)\n",
    "- This commit is called a **merge commit**.\n",
    "- It has **two parent commits** (unlike normal commits with one).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Git examines the branches that are being merged\n",
    "- Let’s say you're merging `feature` into `main`:\n",
    "  - Git checks the **HEAD of `main`** (current branch)\n",
    "  - Git checks the **HEAD of `feature`**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Git finds a common ancestor commit\n",
    "- This is the **last shared commit** between both branches.\n",
    "- It’s the point where the branches **diverged**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Git compares changes made on both branches\n",
    "- Git looks at:\n",
    "  - Changes from `common ancestor` → `main`\n",
    "  - Changes from `common ancestor` → `feature`\n",
    "- It **merges those changes together** line-by-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ A new merge commit is created to record the merge\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Merge branch 'feature' into main\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This commit stores the result of merging.\n",
    "- If there are **no conflicts**, it happens automatically.\n",
    "- If there **are conflicts**, you must resolve them manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Important Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Merging happens **on the currently checked-out branch**.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔴 No new branches are created during a merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you're on `main` and run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge feature\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two main types of merges in Git:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 🔸 1) Fast-Forward Merge\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ This happens **when there’s no divergence** between the branches.\n",

    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "- You were on `main`\n",
    "- You created `feature` and made commits\n",
    "- You never touched `main` again\n",
    "\n",
    "So, `main` can simply **“fast forward”** to point to the `feature` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout main\n",
    "git merge feature\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Result:\n",
    "- No new merge commit is created.\n",
    "- `main` just points to the same commit as `feature`.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 To visualize:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "main:    A → B\n",
    "                \\\n",
    "feature:          C → D\n",
    "\n",
    "After merge:\n",
    "main → A → B → C → D\n",
    "```\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "git log --oneline --graph --all\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll see a **straight line** of commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 2) Regular Merge (a.k.a. Merge with Divergent History)\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens when **both branches have diverged** (i.e. both have new commits).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Git finds a **common ancestor**\n",
    "- Combines both sets of changes\n",
    "- Creates a **new merge commit**\n",

    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✨ Bonus: Disable Fast Forward (always create merge commits)\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge --no-ff feature\n",
