1- Why study seaborn when we have maplotlib ?
2- Hierarchy of objects in matplotlib and hierarchy of object in seaborn? Their connection and theor detail?
	> Who seaborn allows to plot same graph using 2 different functions.
3- Main classification of graphs in Seaborn (theory): (see the pic for reference in lecture floder)
- Relational Plot 
- Distribution Plot
- Matrix Plot
- Categorical Plot
- Regression Plot
- Multiplots

4- When to use axes function and when to use figure function
4.1- Changing height, weight and Aspect of the fugure function and axes function

5- Relational Plots (theory):
	i) Scatter plot using axes and figure functions
	ii) hue, style, size & others  parameter
	
	iii) Line plot and its parameters in axes function and in figure level function
	iv) Who axes and figure function handles the legend, the axes function show legned inside the plot and otherwise.

	v) Facet plot (make multiple plots based on the categories in the columns)
	
	vi) Facet plot (col wrap) and others things about facet plots

6- Distributions plots (theory):
	i) histrogram using axes and figure level 
	ii) bins, hue, elements, faceting  parameters

	iii) kdeplot: theory and how to plot it
	iv) hue and hue_fill and facet plot

	v) rug plot theory and its parameters

	vi) Bivariate histogram 
	vii) Bivariate kdeplot with fill

7- Matrix plots (theory):
	i)Heatmap (there's no figure function), size change
	ii) linewidth, linecolor, cmap
	
	iii) Clustermap (theory,use), code
