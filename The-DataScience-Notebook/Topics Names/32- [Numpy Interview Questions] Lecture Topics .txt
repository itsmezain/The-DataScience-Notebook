1- Consume Flask API from last video
-> There is  a two parts about the API i) API Cratetation and ii) API Consumption

2- 		Numpy Left Topics
	------------------------------------------------
i) meshgrids and its benefits and real life example
ii)plotting 3D graphs and its benefits and real life example
iii) Working with random:
	a) randint
	b) seed
	c)shuffle
	d) choice
iv) working with images => how images are stored in the form of pixels, difference between grayscale and colour image
	A) read the image => using OpenCv to load the image
	B) Showing/printing the image
	C) Flip the image
	D) Clip the image using np.clip
	E) Negative (255- image_array)
	F) trim the image to select specific area of the image
	G) More image manipulation usng Numpy
v) Structured arrays and its benefit and where we use it.
