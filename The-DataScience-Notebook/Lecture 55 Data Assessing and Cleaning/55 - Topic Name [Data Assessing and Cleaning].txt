1- Data Wrangling (theory)
	- Data gathering
	- Data Assesing
	- Data cleaning

2- Type of unclean data: i) Dirsty data ii) Messy Data

3- What to do when you first got the dataset?
	i) Write summary of the data
	 make sense of data, one way to do it by writing the summary of the data, like people do in kaagle.
	- you use google to understand the data or ask expert in the field teach you about the data

	ii) Write column descriptions
	iii) Add any additional information

4- Data Assessment (theroy)
	Types:
		i) Manual => Looking through the data manually in google sheets
		ii) Programmic => By using pandas functions such as head, tail, info(), describe() or sample()
	
	Steps:
		i) Discover
		ii) Documnet

5- Data Quality Dimensions (messy data are of 4 types):
	- completness, validlity, accuracy, consistency
	- Order of severity: 
		Completeness <- Validity <- Accuracy <- Consistency 

6- Data Cleaning Order (theroy):
	i. Quality -> Completeness
	ii. Tidiness (messy data)
	iii. Quality -> Validity
	iv. Quality -> Accuracy
	v. Quality -> Consistency
Steps involved in data cleaning:
		i) define
		ii) Code
		iii) test

7- Cleaning a real world data using the Data Cleaning Order and its steps
