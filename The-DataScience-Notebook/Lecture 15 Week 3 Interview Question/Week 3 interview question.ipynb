    "## 1. Overview of Sets in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A **set** in Python is an unordered collection of unique and immutable elements. Sets are mutable objects, meaning you can add or remove elements. They are commonly used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removing duplicates from lists or other collections.\n",
    "- Performing mathematical set operations (union, intersection, difference).\n",
    "- Efficient membership testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are implemented using **hash tables**, which allow for fast lookup, insertion, and deletion of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Understanding Hash Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash functions play a central role in the functioning of sets. A hash function takes input data (of arbitrary size) and returns an integer, known as the **hash value** or **hash code**, which is of a fixed size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 The `__hash__()` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, every object has a `__hash__()` method that returns its hash value. This method is used by hash-based collections like sets and dictionaries to determine where to store the object in the underlying hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For built-in immutable types (e.g., integers, strings, tuples), Python provides default `__hash__()` implementations. Mutable types like lists and dictionaries are not hashable by default and cannot be used as elements of a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(hash(42))            # Output: 42 (Hash value for an integer)\n",
    "print(hash('hello'))       # Output: Hash value for a string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Hash Values and Equality\n",
    "\n",
    "For objects to be stored correctly in a set:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If two objects are equal (`__eq__()` returns `True`), they must have the same hash value.\n",
    "- If two objects have the same hash value, they may or may not be equal (hash collisions can occur).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Implementation of Sets Using Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 What is a Hash Table?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hash table** is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Set Internal Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a set is implemented as a dictionary with only keys and no associated values. The hash table uses the hash value of each element to determine where to store the element in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each slot in the hash table can be in one of three states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Empty**: The slot has never been used.\n",
    "- **Used**: The slot is currently occupied by an element.\n",
    "- **Previously Used**: The slot was used but is now deleted (special markers are used for this state).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Adding Elements to a Set\n",
    "\n",
    "When an element is added to a set:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `__hash__()` method of the element is called to compute its hash value.\n",
    "2. The hash value is transformed into an index in the hash table (this involves modulus operation with the table size).\n",
    "3. If the calculated slot is empty, the element is placed there.\n",
    "4. If the slot is occupied (collision), a probing mechanism is used to find the next available slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. How Hashing Affects Element Placement\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Calculating Hash Indices\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash value of an element is used to calculate an **index** into the hash table array where the element will be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hash Index Calculation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  index = hash(element) % table_size\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Table Size**: The size of the internal array (hash table), which is typically a prime number to reduce collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Collision Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Collisions occur when two elements have hash values that map to the same index. Python uses **Open Addressing** with **Linear Probing** to resolve collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Probing**: If a collision occurs, the algorithm checks the next slot (index + 1) and continues this process until an empty slot is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Element `a` with `hash(a) = 10`, table size `8`, index `10 % 8 = 2`.\n",
    "2. Element `b` with `hash(b) = 18`, index `18 % 8 = 2` (collision).\n",
    "3. Probing moves to index `3`, `4`, etc., until an empty slot is found.\n",

    "## 5. Ordering in Sets and its Relation to Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Sets are Unordered Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets in Python are defined as unordered collections because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The order of elements is not preserved.\n",
    "- The order can change when elements are added or removed.\n",
    "- The iteration order is based on the internal state of the hash table, which can be affected by various factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Apparent Order Due to Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "While sets are unordered, you might observe that the elements appear in a certain order when iterating, especially in small sets. This apparent order is a side effect of the hash values and the internal state of the hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **this order is not guaranteed**, and you should **not rely on it**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_set = {3, 2, 1}\n",
    "for element in my_set:\n",
    "    print(element)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But it could also be any permutation, depending on the hash values and Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Hash Randomization and Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from Python 3.3, **hash randomization** was introduced to prevent certain types of security attacks (e.g., denial-of-service attacks by exploiting predictable hash values).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effect**: The hash seed is randomized for each Python process, leading to different hash values across different runs.\n",
    "- **Impact**: The iteration order of sets (and dictionaries) can vary between program executions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: Due to hash randomization, the ordering of elements when iterating over a set may be different each time you run your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Rehashing and Resizing of Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Load Factor and Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "The **load factor** of a hash table is the ratio of the number of elements to the table size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimal Load Factor**: To maintain efficient performance (O(1) average time complexity), the load factor should be kept below a certain threshold (e.g., 2/3).\n",
    "- **Performance Degradation**: A high load factor increases the number of collisions and degrades performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Rehashing Process\n",
    "\n",
    "When the set grows and reaches a certain load factor:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resizing**: The hash table is resized to a larger size (usually doubled).\n",
    "2. **Rehashing**: All existing elements are rehashed and placed into the new table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact on Ordering**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rehashing process can cause the positions of elements in the hash table to change.\n",
    "- This can alter the iteration order of the set.\n",

    "## 7. Hash Functions for Custom Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Defining `__hash__()` and `__eq__()`\n",
    "\n",
    "For custom objects to be used in sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implement `__hash__()`**: Return an integer hash value for the object.\n",
    "- **Implement `__eq__()`**: Define equality comparison between objects.\n",
    "\n",

    "        return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 Ensuring Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objects that are equal (`__eq__()` returns `True`) must have the same hash value.\n",
    "- The hash value of an object should not change during its lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immutable Objects**:\n",

    "**Iteration Order**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When iterating, elements may be returned in the order of their placement in the hash table.\n",

    "\n",
    "When two elements have the same hash value (collision):\n",

    "## 10. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the hashing mechanism in Python sets provides valuable insights into their behavior and performance characteristics. Hashing determines how elements are stored in sets, how efficiently operations can be performed, and influences the iteration order, albeit in an unpredictable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sets use hash tables to store elements, leveraging hash values for placement.\n",
    "- The hash value of an element, obtained via its `__hash__()` method, determines its position in the hash table.\n",
    "- Sets are inherently unordered; any apparent order when iterating over a set is a side effect of the hashing mechanism and internal state.\n",
    "- Hash randomization in Python can cause the iteration order of sets to vary between runs.\n",
    "- Proper implementation of `__hash__()` and `__eq__()` for custom objects is critical for correct behavior in sets.\n",
    "- Avoid relying on the order of elements in a set; use appropriate data structures if order is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these concepts, you can effectively utilize sets in Python, optimize performance, and avoid common pitfalls associated with hashing and ordering.\n",

    "## 1. Understanding Dictionaries in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 What is a Dictionary?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **dictionary** in Python is an unordered collection of items that are stored as key-value pairs. Dictionaries allow for fast retrieval of values when the corresponding key is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'cherry': 3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 How Dictionaries Work Internally\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, dictionaries are implemented using **hash tables**, which allow for efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion of key-value pairs. When a key-value pair is added to a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The key's **hash value** is computed using a hash function (`__hash__()` method).\n",
    "2. This hash value is used to determine where to place the key-value pair in the internal hash table.\n",
    "3. When retrieving a value, the hash of the key is computed again to find the correct location in the hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dictionaries rely on hash values of keys for efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "- The integrity of the dictionary depends on the consistency of the hash values of keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Hashability and Hash Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 What is Hashing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hashing** is the process of converting data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size value, known as a **hash value** or **hash code**. A **hash function** is used to perform this conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties of a Good Hash Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deterministic**: The same input always produces the same hash value.\n",
    "- **Uniform Distribution**: Hash values are evenly distributed to minimize collisions.\n",
    "- **Quick Computation**: The hash function should be efficient to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Purpose of Hash Functions in Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "In dictionaries, hash functions are used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the hash value of keys.\n",
    "- Use hash values to index into the internal hash table for storing key-value pairs.\n",
    "- Ensure quick retrieval by computing the hash value of the key during lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 The `__hash__()` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, objects that need to be hashable must implement the `__hash__()` method, which returns an integer hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "## 4. Why Dictionary Keys Must Be Immutable\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Requirement for Hashability\n",
    "\n",
    "For an object to be used as a dictionary key, it must be **hashable**. Hashable objects in Python must meet the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have a hash value that does not change during its lifetime (`__hash__()` method).\n",
    "- Be comparable to other objects (`__eq__()` method).\n",
    "- If two objects are equal (`__eq__()` returns `True`), their hash values must also be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Immutable Objects as Hashable Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable objects are suitable as dictionary keys because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Their state does not change after creation.\n",
    "- Their hash value remains constant, ensuring that the key can be reliably found in the hash table.\n",
    "- They provide consistency between `__hash__()` and `__eq__()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Consequences of Using Mutable Objects as Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Using mutable objects as dictionary keys can lead to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inconsistent Hash Values**: If the object changes after insertion, its hash value may change, making it impossible to locate in the hash table.\n",
    "- **Hash Table Corruption**: The integrity of the dictionary's internal structure relies on consistent hash values; mutable keys can disrupt this.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "- It can be compared to other objects (supports `__eq__()`).\n",
    "- It can be used as a dictionary key or set member.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, objects are hashable by default if their class does not override the `__hash__()` method, and they are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Examples of Hashable and Unhashable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hashable Types**:\n",
    "  - Numbers: `int`, `float`, `complex`\n",

    "The `enumerate()` function in Python is a built-in utility that simplifies the process of iterating over iterable objects (like lists, tuples, or strings) while keeping track of the current index. It is particularly useful in situations where you need both the index and the value during iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is everything you need to know about `enumerate()` in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Syntax of `enumerate()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "enumerate(iterable, start=0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**:\n",
    "  - `iterable`: The object to be enumerated (e.g., a list, tuple, string, or any other iterable).\n",
    "  - `start` (optional): An integer specifying the starting index for the enumeration. The default is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Returns**:\n",
    "  - An `enumerate` object, which yields pairs of `(index, value)` for each item in the iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Basic Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `enumerate()` in a `for` loop allows you to access both the index and the value of each item in the iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
    "    print(f\"Index: {index}, Fruit: {fruit}\")\n",

    "Index: 0, Fruit: apple\n",
    "Index: 1, Fruit: banana\n",
    "Index: 2, Fruit: cherry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Using the `start` Parameter**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `start` parameter can be used to change the starting index from `0` to any other integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits, start=1):\n",
    "    print(f\"Index: {index}, Fruit: {fruit}\")\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Practical Applications of `enumerate()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Updating Items in a List by Index**\n",
    "When you need to modify elements of a list, `enumerate()` provides the index to access and update specific elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "for index, value in enumerate(numbers):\n",
    "    numbers[index] = value + 5\n",
    "\n",
    "print(numbers)\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[15, 25, 35, 45]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Creating a Dictionary from an Iterable**\n",
    "You can use `enumerate()` to create a dictionary where indices are keys, and items are values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "fruit_dict = {index: fruit for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits)}\n",
    "\n",
    "print(fruit_dict)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "{0: 'apple', 1: 'banana', 2: 'cherry'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Tracking Index in Strings**\n",
    "You can enumerate over a string to track the position of each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"hello\"\n",
    "for index, char in enumerate(text):\n",
    "    print(f\"Character '{char}' is at index {index}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Character 'h' is at index 0\n",
    "Character 'e' is at index 1\n",
    "Character 'l' is at index 2\n",
    "Character 'l' is at index 3\n",
    "Character 'o' is at index 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Advanced Usage of `enumerate()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Using `enumerate()` with Filtering**\n",
    "You can use `enumerate()` along with conditional statements to filter items based on their index or value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
    "    if index % 2 == 0:  # Only print even-indexed items\n",
    "        print(f\"Index: {index}, Fruit: {fruit}\")\n",

    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Index: 0, Fruit: apple\n",
    "Index: 2, Fruit: cherry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Enumerating Multiple Iterables**\n",
    "While `enumerate()` itself works on a single iterable, you can combine it with `zip()` to enumerate multiple iterables simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']\n",
    "scores = [85, 92, 78]\n",
    "\n",
    "for index, (name, score) in enumerate(zip(names, scores), start=1):\n",
    "    print(f\"{index}. {name} scored {score}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Alice scored 85\n",
    "2. Bob scored 92\n",
    "3. Charlie scored 78\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Performance of `enumerate()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `enumerate()` function is efficient and optimized for Python's runtime. It does not create a separate list or copy the data; instead, it returns an iterator, which is memory-efficient for large iterables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Efficiency Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "nums = range(1000000)\n",
    "enum_nums = enumerate(nums)\n",
    "print(sys.getsizeof(nums))       # Memory size of the range object\n",
    "print(sys.getsizeof(enum_nums))  # Memory size of the enumerate object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Behind the Scenes of `enumerate()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `enumerate()` function is implemented in C for CPython (Python's most common interpreter). Internally:\n",
    "1. It wraps the iterable into an `enumerate` object.\n",
    "2. It maintains a counter (starting from `start`) and yields `(index, value)` pairs on each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of an Equivalent Implementation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def custom_enumerate(iterable, start=0):\n",
    "    index = start\n",
    "    for item in iterable:\n",
    "        yield index, item\n",
    "        index += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for index, value in custom_enumerate(['a', 'b', 'c'], start=1):\n",
    "    print(index, value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Common Mistakes with `enumerate()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Forgetting to Unpack `(index, value)`\n",
    "If you forget to unpack the `(index, value)` pair, you’ll encounter errors or unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorrect Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "for pair in enumerate(fruits):\n",
    "    print(pair)  # Outputs (index, value) tuples instead of individual items\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "(0, 'apple')\n",
    "(1, 'banana')\n",
    "(2, 'cherry')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. Modifying the Iterable During Enumeration\n",
    "Altering the iterable while using `enumerate()` can lead to unpredictable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "for index, value in enumerate(numbers):\n",
    "    numbers[index] += 10\n",
    "    numbers.append(5)  # Modifying the list during iteration\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Avoid modifying the iterable during iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Key Points to Remember**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `enumerate()` is ideal when you need both the index and the value of items in an iterable.\n",
    "2. It is memory-efficient, as it does not create a copy of the iterable.\n",
    "3. It supports a `start` parameter to customize the starting index.\n",
    "4. Works seamlessly with any iterable, including lists, tuples, strings, and generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Real-World Applications of `enumerate()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Processing**: Access both the index and value when cleaning or transforming data.\n",
    "2. **Debugging**: Identify problematic items in an iterable by printing their indices.\n",
    "3. **User Interfaces**: Numbering items in menus or lists for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "menu = ['Home', 'About', 'Contact']\n",
    "print(\"Menu:\")\n",
    "for index, item in enumerate(menu, start=1):\n",
    "    print(f\"{index}. {item}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Menu:\n",
    "1. Home\n",
    "2. About\n",
    "3. Contact\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The `enumerate()` function is a powerful tool in Python, offering an elegant and efficient way to loop through iterables with index tracking. By understanding its syntax, applications, and inner workings, you can leverage it effectively in a wide range of programming scenarios."

Destructors are less commonly used compared to constructors, but they are essential for managing resources such as files, network connections, or database connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will comprehensively cover everything you need to know about destructors in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **What is a Destructor?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A destructor is a method named `__del__` in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
    "- It allows you to define cleanup behavior for an object, such as releasing external resources or freeing memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    def __del__(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Destructor called. Object is being deleted.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = Example()\n",
    "del obj\n",
    "```\n",

    "Destructor called. Object is being deleted.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Syntax of a Destructor**\n",
    "\n",
    "The destructor is defined using the `__del__` method inside a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    def __del__(self):\n",
    "        # Cleanup code here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- The `__del__` method does not take any arguments except `self`.\n",
    "- It is automatically invoked by Python's garbage collector when an object is no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **When is the Destructor Called?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Destructors are called when:\n",
    "1. An object goes out of scope.\n",
    "2. An object is explicitly deleted using the `del` statement.\n",
    "3. The reference count of an object drops to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Reference Count Behavior:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Demo:\n",
    "    def __del__(self):\n",

    "\n",
    "Python uses **automatic garbage collection** to manage memory. The garbage collector:\n",
    "- Keeps track of the reference count for each object.\n",
    "- Deletes objects when their reference count becomes zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5. **Explicit vs. Implicit Destructor Calls**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explicit Destructor Call\n",
    "You can explicitly delete an object using the `del` statement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "obj = Sample()\n",
    "del obj  # Explicitly deletes the object\n",
    "```\n",

    "    obj = Sample()\n",
    "    print(\"Object created.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "create_object()  # obj goes out of scope when the function ends\n",

    "\n",
    "#### a. Releasing External Resources\n",
    "Destructors can release external resources like files, sockets, or database connections.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### b. Cleaning Up Memory\n",
    "Destructors can release memory held by large objects, like data structures or images.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Cyclic References and Destructors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's garbage collector can detect cyclic references (e.g., objects referring to each other), but such cycles can prevent the `__del__` method from being called.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Cyclic Reference:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.ref = None\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __del__(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Destructor of A called.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "obj1 = A()\n",
    "obj2 = A()\n",
    "obj1.ref = obj2\n",
    "obj2.ref = obj1\n",
    "del obj1\n",
    "del obj2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, destructors may not be called because of the cyclic reference. To handle such cases, Python provides the `gc` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Best Practices for Using Destructors**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avoid Complex Logic in `__del__`:**\n",
    "   - Keep the destructor simple to avoid potential errors or exceptions during cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Context Managers When Possible:**\n",
    "   - Prefer `with` statements and context managers for resource management. Context managers automatically handle resource cleanup.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",

    "\n",
    "Destructors (`__del__`) in Python are essential tools for managing cleanup tasks and freeing resources. However, due to their unpredictable nature and potential limitations, destructors should be used sparingly and only for non-critical cleanup tasks. For better resource management, rely on context managers and explicit cleanup methods where possible."

    "This document provides detailed and exhaustive explanations of the `dir()`, `isinstance()`, and `issubclass()` functions in Python. These built-in functions are commonly used for introspection and type-checking in Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`dir()` Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dir()` function is used for introspection. It returns a list of attributes (including methods) of an object. This function is invaluable for exploring the properties and methods of Python objects during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dir([object])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter:**\n",
    "  - `object` (optional): If provided, `dir()` returns a list of attributes and methods of the specified object. \n",
    "  - If no parameter is passed, `dir()` returns the names in the current local scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Returns:**\n",
    "  - A sorted list of strings representing the attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Without Arguments:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(dir())\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   **Output:** List of names in the current local scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **With an Object:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Sample:\n",
    "       def __init__(self):\n",
    "           self.value = 10\n",
    "       \n",

    "   obj = Sample()\n",
    "   print(dir(obj))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   **Output:** A list containing `['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', ... 'greet', 'value']`.\n",

    "3. **On Built-in Types:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(dir(list))\n",
    "   print(dir(str))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   **Output:** Lists all methods and attributes specific to the `list` and `str` types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Cases:**\n",
    "- To explore the methods and attributes of custom or built-in objects.\n",
    "- Debugging and understanding unfamiliar objects or modules.\n",
    "- Getting the local scope of the current runtime environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Points:**\n",

    "#### **Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "isinstance(object, classinfo)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters:**\n",
    "  - `object`: The object to be checked.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Returns:**\n",
    "  - `True` if `object` is an instance of `classinfo` or a subclass of `classinfo`.\n",
    "  - `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Usage:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(isinstance(5, int))            # True\n",
    "   print(isinstance(\"hello\", str))     # True\n",
    "   print(isinstance(5.5, float))       # True\n",
    "   print(isinstance(5, float))         # False\n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(isinstance(5, (int, float)))  # True\n",
    "   print(isinstance(\"hello\", (int, str)))  # True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Cases:**\n",
    "- Type-checking before performing operations.\n",
    "- Ensuring that a function receives inputs of expected types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Points:**\n",
    "- Using `isinstance()` is safer than `type()` for checking types because it accounts for inheritance.\n",

    "  - `True` if `class` is a subclass (directly or indirectly) of `classinfo`.\n",
    "  - `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Usage:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Animal:\n",
    "       pass\n",

    "## 1. Overview of Methods in Python Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, methods are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors of an object. They can manipulate the object's state, access class-level data, or perform utility functions. Python provides three types of methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance Methods**: Operate on the instance of the class.\n",
    "- **Class Methods**: Operate on the class itself.\n",
    "- **Static Methods**: Do not operate on either the instance or the class; they are utility functions within the class's namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method type is distinguished by how it receives its first parameter and how it is decorated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"2-instance-methods\"></a>\n",
    "## 2. Instance Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "An **instance method** is a method that operates on an instance of a class. It can access and modify the instance's attributes and other instance methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first parameter is always `self`, which refers to the specific instance of the class.\n",
    "- Can access and modify instance variables and access class variables.\n",
    "- Can call other instance methods and class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Defining Instance Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance methods are defined without any decorators. The first parameter must be `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def instance_method(self, args):\n",
    "        # Method body\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Accessing Instance Variables and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Within an instance method, you can access instance variables and methods via `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value  # Instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def instance_method(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"The value is {self.value}\")  # Access instance variable\n",

    "# Usage\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "my_dog.bark()  # Output: Buddy says woof!\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 3.1 Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class method** is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. It can access class variables and modify class state that applies across all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first parameter is `cls`, which refers to the class itself.\n",

    "- Can access and modify class variables.\n",
    "- Cannot access or modify instance variables unless passed in.\n",

    "### 3.4 Accessing Class Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods can access class variables via `cls`.\n",

    "The **diamond problem** is a classical problem in object-oriented programming that occurs in languages that support **multiple inheritance**, including Python. It arises when a class inherits from two or more classes that have a common ancestor, creating ambiguity in the inheritance hierarchy.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Understanding the Diamond Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is the Diamond Problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The diamond problem occurs when:\n",
    "1. A class (`D`) inherits from two classes (`B` and `C`), and both of those classes inherit from a common superclass (`A`).\n",
    "2. This forms a **diamond-shaped inheritance structure**:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "           A\n",
    "         /   \\\n",
    "        B     C\n",
    "         \\   /\n",
    "           D\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. The issue arises when you try to access a method or attribute that is defined in the common superclass (`A`). There is ambiguity about which path (`A` via `B` or `A` via `C`) should be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problems Caused by the Diamond Structure**\n",
    "1. **Method Resolution Order (MRO) Confusion:**\n",
    "   - In multiple inheritance, the order in which Python searches for methods and attributes is crucial.\n",
    "   - Without a clear resolution strategy, a method in the common superclass (`A`) may be called twice or not at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code Duplication:**\n",
    "   - If the same method in `A` is executed twice (once through `B` and once through `C`), it can cause unexpected behavior, such as modifying data twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ambiguity:**\n",
    "   - It’s unclear which parent class’s implementation to prioritize.\n",

    "## **How Python Handles the Diamond Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python resolves the diamond problem using the **C3 Linearization Algorithm**, which determines a clear **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts of MRO:**\n",
    "1. **Linearization:** Python constructs a linear order of classes in the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "2. **`super()` Function:** Python uses `super()` to ensure that methods from the common ancestor are not called multiple times.\n",
    "3. **Class Hierarchy Traversal:**\n",
    "   - Python traverses classes from left to right based on the inheritance order in the class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Method Resolution Order in Python**\n",

    "2. **Preservation of Hierarchy:** The order of base classes in the inheritance definition is respected.\n",
    "3. **Avoidance of Redundancy:** The same class appears only once in the MRO.\n",

    "Hello from D\n",
    "Hello from B\n",
    "Hello from C\n",
    "Hello from A\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The `super()` function ensures that methods are called in the order defined by the MRO.\n",
    "- Each class calls the method of the next class in the MRO until the common ancestor (`A`) is reached.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **1. Single Leading Underscore: `_variable`**\n",
    "\n",
    "A single leading underscore is a **naming convention** used to indicate that a variable or method is intended for **internal use only**. It is not enforced by Python but serves as a hint to other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "- It suggests that the variable or method is **\"private\"**.\n",
    "- The variable or method can still be accessed directly.\n",
    "- Used primarily to prevent accidental overwriting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",

    "obj = MyClass()\n",
    "print(obj._private_variable)  # Access is still allowed but discouraged\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works:**\n",
    "- In imports, a leading underscore prevents the name from being imported using `from module import *`.\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# module.py\n",
    "_var = 100  # Single leading underscore\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from module import *  # _var will NOT be imported\n",

    "\n",
    "## **2. Single Trailing Underscore: `variable_`**\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Double Leading Underscore: `__variable`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Double leading underscores trigger **name mangling**, which changes the name of the attribute to include the class name as a prefix. This makes it harder to accidentally override or access the variable from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Used to avoid name conflicts in subclasses.\n",

    "## **4. Double Leading and Trailing Underscores: `__variable__`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables or methods surrounded by double underscores are known as **magic methods** or **dunder methods**. These are special methods defined by Python for specific behaviors and are **not meant to be modified** directly.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Define Both Methods if Necessary:**\n",
    "   - `__repr__`: For developers and debugging.\n",
    "   - `__str__`: For user-facing output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Follow Conventions:**\n",
    "   - `__repr__` should return an unambiguous representation, ideally valid Python code.\n",
    "   - `__str__` should return a readable representation.\n",

    "In Python, **sets** are powerful data structures that allow for efficient membership testing and management of unique elements. A common understanding is that only immutable and hashable objects can be stored in sets because sets rely on hash values for their internal organization. However, there is often confusion about how **mutable objects** can be stored in sets, given that mutability can affect hashability.\n",

    "This comprehensive guide will explore how objects, even though they are mutable, can be stored in sets in Python. We will delve deep into the concepts of hashability, mutability, and how Python's data model allows certain mutable objects to be stored in sets. By the end of this guide, you will have an in-depth understanding of this topic, leaving nothing more to learn.\n",

    "## 1. Understanding Sets in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Set?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **set** in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are defined by curly braces `{}` or by using the `set()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics of Sets:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unordered**: Elements are not stored in any particular order.\n",
    "- **Unique Elements**: Duplicate elements are not allowed.\n",
    "- **Mutable**: Sets themselves are mutable; we can add or remove elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Elements of a set must be **immutable** and **hashable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Hashability and Hash Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 What Makes an Object Hashable?\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is **hashable** if it has a hash value that does not change during its lifetime. Hashable objects must have the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implements `__hash__()`**: Returns an integer hash value.\n",
    "- **Implements `__eq__()`**: Can be compared for equality.\n",
    "- **Consistent Hash Value**: If two objects are equal (`__eq__()` returns `True`), they must have the same hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hashable Objects Include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Immutable built-in types:\n",
    "  - Integers (`int`)\n",
    "  - Floats (`float`)\n",
    "  - Strings (`str`)\n",
    "  - Tuples (`tuple`) containing hashable elements\n",
    "  - Frozensets (`frozenset`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Default Hash Behavior in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, user-defined objects are hashable. The default behavior for the `__hash__()` method returns the object's identity (`id(self)`) and the `__eq__()` method compares object identities using `is`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instances of custom classes are hashable unless `__hash__()` or `__eq__()` are overridden.\n",
    "- The default hash value is based on the object's identity, which remains constant during the object's lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Mutability vs. Immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutable Objects**: Objects whose state cannot be modified after they are created.\n",
    "  - Examples: `int`, `float`, `str`, `tuple`, `frozenset`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutable Objects**: Objects that can be modified after creation.\n",
    "  - Examples: `list`, `dict`, `set`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance to Hashing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Immutable objects are typically hashable because their hash value remains constant.\n",
    "- Mutable objects are generally unhashable because changes to their state can change their hash value, leading to inconsistent behavior in hash-based collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 4. Can Mutable Objects Be Stored in Sets?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Mutable but Hashable Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "While mutable built-in types like lists and dictionaries are unhashable (cannot be stored in sets), there are cases where mutable objects can be hashable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instances of User-Defined Classes**: Unless explicitly made unhashable, instances are hashable by default because their hash value is based on their identity (`id(self)`).\n",
    "- **Objects with Custom `__hash__()` Methods**: If the hash function is designed carefully, even mutable objects can have a consistent hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 User-Defined Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default, even if they have mutable attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = MyClass()\n",
    "print(hash(obj))  # This works because obj is hashable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Default `__hash__()` Implementation**: Returns a hash based on the object's identity.\n",
    "- **Default `__eq__()` Implementation**: Compares object identity using `is`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Identity vs. Value-Based Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identity-Based Hashing**: Hash value is based on the object's identity (memory address). Mutations do not affect the hash value.\n",
    "- **Value-Based Hashing**: Hash value is based on the object's state or content. Mutations can affect the hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objects using identity-based hashing can be mutable and still safely stored in sets.\n",
    "- If `__hash__()` or `__eq__()` are overridden to use the object's mutable state, mutability can lead to inconsistent behavior.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Examples of Mutable Objects in Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1: Mutable Objects with Default Hash Behavior**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",

    "**Example 2: Mutable Objects with Custom Immutable Hash**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Coordinate:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x, y):\n",

    "\n",
    "- Since `__hash__()` and `__eq__()` are based on mutable attributes, changing `x` or `y` can lead to inconsistent behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Potential Issues and Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hash Value Changes**: If the object's state changes and affects `__hash__()`, the hash value changes, making the object unfindable in the set.\n",
    "- **Set Integrity Violation**: Sets rely on the hash value to locate elements; if the hash value changes, it can corrupt the set's internal structure.\n",

    "\n",
    "When designing mutable objects to be stored in sets, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Identity-Based Hashing**: Base `__hash__()` on the object's identity (`id(self)`).\n",
    "- **Override `__hash__()` Properly**: Ensure that `__hash__()` does not change during the object's lifetime.\n",
    "- **Implement `__eq__()` Consistently**: Ensure that equality checks are consistent with `__hash__()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MutableItem:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value  # Mutable attribute\n",

    "    def __eq__(self, other):\n",
    "        # Compare identities\n",
    "        return self is other\n",

    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Ensuring Consistent Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoid Basing Hash on Mutable Attributes**: Do not use mutable attributes in `__hash__()` or `__eq__()`.\n",
    "- **If Using Mutable State in Hashing**:\n",
    "  - Ensure that the state does not change after insertion into a set.\n",
    "  - Consider making the object effectively immutable after insertion.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Avoiding Mutable Keys When Possible\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Immutable Types as Set Elements**: Prefer using immutable objects to avoid issues with changing hash values.\n",
    "- **Convert Mutable Data to Immutable Equivalents**: For example, convert lists to tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 Using Immutable Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutable Proxies**: Wrap mutable objects in an immutable wrapper that provides stable hash values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ImmutableWrapper:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, obj):\n",
    "        self._obj = obj  # Mutable object\n",
    "\n",

    "        return hash(id(self._obj))\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __eq__(self, other):\n",
    "        return self._obj is other._obj\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3 Careful Design of Custom Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensure Hash Value Does Not Change**: If your object is mutable, design it so that changes do not affect the hash value.\n",
    "- **Avoid Overriding `__eq__()` and `__hash__()` Based on Mutable State**: This prevents inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, while the common understanding is that only immutable objects can be stored in sets, mutable objects can indeed be stored in sets as long as they are **hashable**. The key requirements are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hashable**: The object must implement `__hash__()` and `__eq__()`, and the hash value must remain constant during the object's lifetime.\n",
    "- **Consistent Hashing**: If the object changes and this impacts the hash value, it can lead to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instances of User-Defined Classes Are Hashable by Default**: Their hash is based on their identity.\n",
    "- **Mutable Objects Can Be Stored in Sets**: Provided their hash value does not change.\n",
    "- **Be Cautious with Mutable State**: Avoid basing hash values on mutable attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these principles, you can effectively manage sets containing mutable objects in Python while avoiding common pitfalls associated with hashability and mutability.\n",

    "### Easy explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's break it down in a simpler and more informal way! 😊\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Sets Need Immutable Elements**\n",
    "A set is like a bag where Python keeps things organized using numbers called **hash values**. These hash values are like unique IDs for each item in the set. Python uses these IDs to quickly find things in the bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here’s the rule: these IDs (hash values) must **never change** once the item is in the set. Why? Because if the hash changes, Python won’t know where to look for it in the bag anymore! It’s like trying to find a book in the library after someone swapped the labels on the shelves—it causes chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What About Objects? Aren’t They Mutable?**\n",
    "Now, objects in Python (like instances of classes) are mutable. That means you can change their internal data. So how can they be in a set?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the trick: what matters to Python isn’t whether the object’s data can change, but whether **the part of the object that decides its hash value stays the same**. If the hash value stays constant, Python is happy to add the object to the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-Life Analogy**\n",
    "Imagine you’re at a party, and the host is giving you a wristband with a number (your hash value) to let you in. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutable objects**: You’re like a robot with a fixed wristband. You’ll always wear that same wristband number.\n",
    "- **Mutable objects**: You’re like a human. You might lose the wristband or swap it for another, and the host would have no idea who you are anymore if you leave and come back.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you’re a human (mutable object), the host (Python) asks you to promise: “Once I give you a wristband, don’t lose it or change it, okay?” If you keep the wristband intact (hash value stays constant), the host is cool with letting you in.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Happens If the Hash Changes?**\n",
    "If you’re sneaky and manage to change your wristband number after you’re in, the host can’t recognize you anymore. That’s why Python gets confused if you change the data of an object in the set—it doesn’t know where to find you.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example to Understand**\n",
    "Let’s say we have a class for party guests:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Guest:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Mutable attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __hash__(self):\n",
    "        return hash(self.name)  # Hash based on name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __eq__(self, other):\n",
    "        return self.name == other.name  # Equal if names match\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now:\n",
    "1. You add a guest `Guest(\"Alice\")` to the set.\n",
    "2. Python stores her using her **name**'s hash value.\n",
    "3. Later, if you change `Alice`’s name to `Bob`, Python doesn’t know this is the same person anymore. The set is messed up!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaway**\n",
    "Mutable objects can go into sets **if their hash values don’t depend on things that can change**. If you change something that affects the hash, Python loses track of the object, and things go haywire.\n",

    "### Identity-Based Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you create an object (like an instance of a class), Python automatically gives it a unique ID.\n",
    "- This ID is tied to where the object is stored in memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Avoid Mutating Objects Used in Sets:**\n",
    "   - If you store an object in a set, avoid changing the parts that affect its hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Immutable Types for Hashing:**\n",
    "   - If you need to override `__hash__()`, use immutable attributes to compute the hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Don't Override `__hash__()` Unnecessarily:**\n",
    "   - If you don't need custom behavior, rely on the default `__hash__()` which is based on the object's ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutable objects can be stored in sets** if their hash value remains constant.\n",
    "- **By default**, objects in Python are hashable because their hash is based on their identity (memory address).\n",
    "- **Mutating attributes won't affect the hash** if the hash is based on the object's ID.\n",
    "- **Be careful** when overriding `__hash__()` and `__eq__()`—don't base them on mutable attributes unless you're sure those attributes won't change.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a set like a library catalog that organizes books by ISBN numbers (unique identifiers).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even if someone writes notes or highlights in the book (mutates its content), the ISBN remains the same.\n",
    "- The library can always find the book because the identifier hasn't changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if the book's ISBN changed every time someone wrote in it, the library wouldn't be able to find it anymore.\n",
    "\n",
